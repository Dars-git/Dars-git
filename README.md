# 💫 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m **Darshan Vaghasiya**, a Software Engineer based in **Baltimore, MD**. I graduated from the **University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)** with a Master’s degree in Software Engineering and have been actively building and refining production-style systems for the past **1.5 years**.


My work focuses on **backend engineering, microservices architecture, cloud-native applications, and AI-powered systems**. I’ve designed and implemented distributed systems using **Spring Boot and Spring Cloud**, built full-stack applications deployed on **AWS and Kubernetes**, and developed intelligent tools using **LLMs, FastAPI, and vector databases**.


I enjoy solving complex system design problems, building scalable APIs, and working across the stack to deliver reliable, maintainable software. I’m comfortable in Agile environments and value clean architecture, performance, and real-world impact.


Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies, traveling, and continuously sharpening my engineering skills.
